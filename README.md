# ConfluenceSearch
A chrome extension for text search on confluence pages. Searches through tabs (written for confluence 6.15.10)

In Confluence 6.15.10 you can create tab menus in pages but there doesn't seem to be a way to do a text search that searches all of these these hidden pieces of the page. Here's an attempt to remedy the issue.
